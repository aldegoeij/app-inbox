# app-inbox
Electron based, cross-platform, minimal Google Inbox app.

Getting totally annoyed not being able to Alt-Tab to a dedicated window for Inbox.

Aim is to support Windows, Mac OS X Sierra and Ubuntu (Gnome), fancy features (notifications, trays) will come as I miss them :)

Feel free to send pull-requests, please don't fork ;)
